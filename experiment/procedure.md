## Characterize of LVDT
### The procedure for using simulator is as follows:
To find the effect of various parameters like change in supply voltage, change in supply frequency on output of given LVDT, click on Simulator Tab. The procedure to use the simulator is given below. 

### Procedure:

1. First you need to configure the LVDT. Click on ' Show panel' tab at the right bottom For making the circuit, drag and drop the primary coil, Armature and secondary coils at the loactions shown on left hand side.
2. Now select No of Turns, peak to peak supply volatge and frequency from the drag and drop menu, available below LVDT diagram. Click on configure block to configure LVDT.
3. Now click on the black rectangular core placed between primary and secondary windings.
4. Drag the core to left hand side and observe the effect on the output magnitude. This can be observed on the time vs output volatge waveform and on the Distance vs output voltage graph. The core displacement is indicated in the square box below the diagram
5. Drag the core to right hand side and observe the effect on the output magnitude. Also observe the change in the phase.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 4 by changing supply volatge keeping frequency and no of turns constant.
7. Study the effect on the output voltage. For this click on blue color 'Configure' tab in the right side panel. You need to select required parameter value from drop down menu. After selecting the values click on green ' Configure' tab to set the parameter values.
8. Repeat steps 2 to 4 by changing supply frequency keeping and no of turns constant. Study the effect on the output voltage.
Now keep supply voltage and frequency constant. Change the no of turns and observe the effect on the output voltage by repeating steps 2 to 4.
